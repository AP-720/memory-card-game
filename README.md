# Memory Card Project

## Images

- Need to get images from an API.
- Then display images in random order. 
- Will need to map over them and create cards for each one.
- Will need to track if an image has been clicked on before. 
- Call the random order function when one is selected. 

## Score Board

- This will be its own component. Maybe split down into the current score and the high score. 
- track the current score 
- track the highest ever score
